# Testcase wm2_verify_associated_clients

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify that the client can associate with DUT AP. The association is verified by
inspecting the OVSDB `Wifi_Associated_Client` table.

**Note:**\
The testcase tests wireless clients with support for WPA2 and WPA3.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

The `Wifi_Associated_Clients` table must exist and is populated.\
Client MAC is found in the `Wifi_Associated_Clients`
table.\
For a WPA2 client, field `status` must be set to `active`.\
For a WPA3 client, the client must be associated to
the VIF interface.
