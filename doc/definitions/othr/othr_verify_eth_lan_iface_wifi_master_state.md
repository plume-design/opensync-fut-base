# Testcase othr_verify_eth_lan_iface_wifi_master_state

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.

## Testcase description

Testcase verifies that the `Wifi_Master_State` table is populated with Ethernet LAN interfaces.

**Note:**\
NM must populate the `Wifi_Master_State` table. CM is the manager that uses information from the
`Wifi_Master_State` to establish the uplink connection.

**Important:**\
Determine the Ethernet LAN interface name.\
Make sure the Ethernet LAN interface is present in the
`Wifi_Inet_Config` table. If not, the testcase is invalid, and the interface will not appear in the `Wifi_Master_State`
table. This is not a test failure.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

The `Wifi_Master_State` table exists.\
The `Wifi_Master_State` table is populated with LAN interface.

## Implementation status

Implemented
