# Testcase nm2_set_gateway

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify that the `gateway` field in the `Wifi_Inet_Config` table is configurable and that
it can be correctly set.\
Testcase tests the OVSDB level by configuring the OVSDB `Wifi_Inet_Config` table and verifies
that the configuration is reflected in the `Wifi_Inet_State` table.\
Testcase verifies that the de-configuration of the
`gateway` field in the `Wifi_Inet_Config` table.\
Testcase verifies that the setting is applied to the device - LEVEL2.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

Field `gateway` in the `Wifi_Inet_Config` table is configured and reflected in the `Wifi_Inet_State` table.\
Gateway
address is configured on the device - LEVEL2.

Field `gateway` in `Wifi_Inet_State` table is set to an unspecified address (`0.0.0.0`) if `ip_assign_scheme` field in
the `Wifi_Inet_Config` table is set to `none` and field `gateway` in the `Wifi_Inet_Config` table is set to unset
value.\
Gateway address configuration is removed from the device - LEVEL2.

## Implementation status
