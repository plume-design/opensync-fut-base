# Testcase nm2_ovsdb_configure_interface_dhcpd

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify that the `Wifi_Inet_Config` dhcp server and client settings can be set
correctly.\
Testcase tests the OVSDB level by configuring the OVSDB `Wifi_Inet_Config` table, and verifies that the
configuration is reflected in the `Wifi_Inet_State` table.\
The testcase tests if the client set interface can be
disabled.\
The testcase verifies that the setting is applied to the device - LEVEL2.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

`Wifi_Inet_Config` fields `start_pool` and `end_pool` settings are configured and reflected in the `Wifi_Inet_State`
table.\
Settings are configured on the device - LEVEL2.

If the interface is brought down, the correct setting is configured on the device, and if the interface is brought up
again, the expected settings are again applied to the device - LEVEL2.

## Implementation status
