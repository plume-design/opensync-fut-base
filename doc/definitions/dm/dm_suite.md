# DM Testing

## Overview

The DM suite tests the Diagnostic Manager (DM) which is the first manager to be started. DM is responsible for spawning
other managers once the device is ready. DM overviews the device, its managers and is also responsible to populate the
OVSDB tables, e.g., `AWLAN_Node` which is used by the cloud to identify the device and to determine how a device should
be managed.
