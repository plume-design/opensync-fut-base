# Testcase fcm_lan_stats_eth_clients_behind_leaf_and_gw

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
Ethernet client must be connected to the DUT. \
Ethernet clients must be connected to the leaf pod. \
DUT has WAN connectivity.\
MQTT daemon is running on RPI server.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify:

- LAN Stats report is generated by the gateway pod for traffic flowing from the
  Ethernet client connected to the leaf pod to the the Ethernet client
  connected to the gateway pod.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Client device is successfully connected to the DUT.
- Egress and ingress rules are configured in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- `FCM_Collector_Config`, `AWLAN_Node`, `FCM_Report_Config`, `FCM_Filter` and
  `Openflow_Tag` tables are configured.
- Generate traffic between the Ethernet clients using `iperf`.

MQTT LAN stats reports should be generated for the traffic flow.

## Implementation status

Not Implemented
