## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
WIFI client must be connected to the DUT. \
DUT has WAN connectivity.\
MQTT daemon is running on RPI server.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify:

- Interface stats are generated when interface stats are configured.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Client device is successfully connected to the DUT.
- Egress and ingress rules are configured in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- `FCM_Collector_Config`, `AWLAN_Node`, `FCM_Report_Config`, `FCM_Filter` and
