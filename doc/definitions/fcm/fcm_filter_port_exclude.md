# Testcase fcm_filter_port_exclude

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
The wireless client must be connected to the DUT.\
DUT has
WAN connectivity.\
MQTT daemon is running on RPI server.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify:

- FCM can exclude adding flow samples based on the configured source and destination ports.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Client device is successfully connected to the DUT.
- Egress and ingress rules are configured in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- `FCM_Collector_Config`, `AWLAN_Node`, `FCM_Report_Config` and `FCM_Filter` tables are configured.
- `FCM_Filter` table is set to exclude adding samples from particular source and destination ports.
- On the connected client, `iperf` or `nc` command is made.

CT stats should not contain the traffic flow for the selected port.\
MQTT report should not contain traffic flow from
the client.

## Implementation status

Not Implemented
