# Testcase nfm_configure_ebtables_rules

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is configured to use the Native Linux bridge instead of the OVS bridge. Kconfig variable
CONFIG_TARGET_USE_NATIVE_BRIDGE is set when the Native Linux bridge is enabled.

## Testcase description

The goal of this test case is to ensure ebtable rules can be configured using `Netfilter` table.\
Testcase verifies that
the settings are applied to the device - LEVEL2.\
Testcase verifies that the settings are deleted from the device if
deleted from the `Netfilter` table.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

Configure `Netfilter` table with the ebtable rule to be configured and the protocol type set to `eth`

ebtable rules are configured on the device - LEVEL2.\
ebtable rules are deleted from the device when the `Netfilter`
configuration is removed - LEVEL2.\
OpenSync is running and has not experienced a crash.

## Implementation status
