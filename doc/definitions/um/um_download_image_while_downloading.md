# Testcase um_download_image_while_downloading

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.

FW image is available at RPI server. the corresponding md5 file is available at RPI server.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify the correct behavior of the device if download of the FW image is triggered while
the previous download is still in progress.

During the testcase preparation, the second FW image is generated with different name to the original.

The image is first downloaded. Download must start after the `firmware_url` field in the OVSDB table `AWLAN_Node` is
correctly set. After the download process started, the `firmware_url` field is again set with the path to the second
image.

First download must not be interrupted and must finish, which is indicated by the `upgrade_status` in the `AWLAN_Node`
table.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

End of download is indicated by `upgrade_status` field value `UPG_STS_FW_DL_END`.

## Implementation status

Implemented
