# Testcase fsm_test_direction_and_originator_for_udp

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
The wireless client must be connected to the DUT.\
DUT has
WAN connectivity.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify that UDP packets are handled, and that flow direction and originator information
are correct.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Client device is successfully connected to the DUT.
- Egress and ingress rules are configured in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- Configure `Flow_Service_Manager_Config` with core_dpi_dispatch plugin of type `dpi_dispatcher` and then configure
  walleye_dpi of type `dpi_plugin`.
- Run `dig` command from the client for the same endpoint.

The Related FSM log from the connected client exists and contains the verdict received from the Gatekeeper
service.\
Check the FSM log for `net_header_log` details. The flow direction should be set to `outbound`, and the
originator should be set to source for the UDP packets generated by the client.
