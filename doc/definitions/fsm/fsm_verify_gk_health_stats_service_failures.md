# Testcase fsm_verify_gk_health_stats_serviceFailures

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
The wireless client must be connected to the DUT.\
DUT has
WAN connectivity.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify that in "Gatekeeper Health Stats", the value of "serviceFailures" is incremented
by one if FSM can reach the Gatekeeper service, but fails to return a verdict due to some issues in the Gatekeeper
service

- This testcase starts MQTT server on RPI server and configures DUT MQTT client to connect to the RPI server MQTT.

Testcase falls into the category of complex "end-to-end" FSM testcases.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Ingress rule in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- `Flow_Service_Manager_Config` table is configured.
- MQTT is configured.
- Run `curl` command from the client for the same endpoint.

The "serviceFailures" value in "Gatekeeper Health Stats" is incremented by one each time FSM is able to reach the
Gatekeeper service, but the Gatekeeper Service fails to return a verdict due to some issues in the cloud.

## Implementation status

Not Implemented
