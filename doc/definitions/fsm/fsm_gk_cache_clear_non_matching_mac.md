# Testcase fsm_gk_cache_clear_non_matching_mac

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
The wireless client must be connected to the DUT.\
Dev
Gatekeeper Docker instance is running.\
DUT has WAN connectivity.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify:

- Gatekeeper cache should not be deleted if the configured mac in the `FSM_Policy` does not match the cached device.

Testcase falls into the category of complex "end-to-end" FSM testcases.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Client device is successfully connected to the DUT.
- Egress and ingress rules are configured in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- `FSM_Policy`, `Flow_Service_Manager_Config` and `Openflow_Tag` tables are configured.
- `wget` request is made on the connected client to populate entries in Gatekeeper cache.
- Check the Gatekeeper health stats report.
- Create `FSM_Policy` table entry with `action` value `flush`, `macs` value set to random MAC (not matching client's
  MAC) and `mac_op` value set to `in`.
- Check the Gatekeeper health stats report again.

Gatekeeper health stats report should reflect the cached entries.\
The Gatekeeper health stats report generated after
`FSM_Policy` should indicate the entries are still present in the cache.

## Implementation status

Not Implemented
