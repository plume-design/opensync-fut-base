# Testcase fsm_gk_validate_fqdn_url

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
The wireless client must be connected to the DUT.\
DUT has
WAN connectivity.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify:

- FSM validates the FQDN URL before processing it.

Testcase falls into the category of complex "end-to-end" FSM testcases.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Client device is successfully connected to the DUT.
- Egress and ingress rules are configured in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- `FSM_Policy`, `Flow_Service_Manager_Config` and `Openflow_Tag` tables are configured.
- `wget` command is made on the connected client.

FSM should not process the FDQN request if the request is invalid.

## Implementation status
