# Testcase fsm_test_logmacs_policy_with_gatekeeper_allow

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
The wireless client must be connected to the DUT.\
DUT has
WAN connectivity.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify:

FQDN query report is generated by the FSM when `logmacs` policy is configured, followed by the Gatekeeper action policy.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Client device is successfully connected to the DUT.
- Egress and ingress rules are configured in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- Configure DNS parser to process the DNS packets.
- Configure `logMacs` as the first policy in the `FSM_Policy` table.
- Run `dig` command from the client.

The Related FSM log from the connected client exists and contains the verdict received from the Gatekeeper service.\
FSM
should generate the report as part of `logmacs` policy.

## Implementation status
