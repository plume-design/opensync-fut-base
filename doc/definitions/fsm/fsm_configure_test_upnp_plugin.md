# Testcase fsm_configure_test_upnp_plugin

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
The wireless client must be connected to the DUT.\
DUT has
WAN connectivity.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify that the FSM UPnP plugin is correctly configured and the UPnP reply from the
client is detected.\\

FUT client listens to:

- SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) message on port UDP/1900, and replies with a predefined response.
- HTTP GET descr.xml request, and replies with a predefined response.

Replies must be caught on the DUT by inspecting the FSM logs.

This testcase starts MQTT Server on RPI server and configures the DUT MQTT client to connect to the RPI server MQTT.

Testcase falls into the category of complex "end-to-end" FSM testcases.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Ingress rule in the `Openflow_Config` table
- `Flow_Service_Manager_Config` table is configured
- MQTT is configured
- UPnP server is started on the client device

Testcase catches the predefined log entry from FSM UPnP which includes configured device data:

- upnp_deviceType
- upnp_friendlyName
- upnp_manufacturer
- upnp_manufacturerURL
- upnp_modelDescription
- upnp_modelName, upnp_modelNumber

## Implementation status
