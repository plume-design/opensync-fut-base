# Testcase fsm_verify_gk_health_stats_connectivity_failure

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.\
The wireless client must be connected to the DUT.\
DUT has
WAN connectivity.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to verify that in "Gatekeeper Health Stats", the value of "connectivityFailures" is
incremented by one when FSM cannot reach the Gatekeeper Service due to connection issues.

- This testcase starts MQTT Server on RPI server and configures DUT MQTT client to connect it to the RPI server MQTT.

Testcase falls into the category of complex "end-to-end" FSM testcases.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

After:

- Ingress rule in the `Openflow_Config` table.
- `Flow_Service_Manager_Config` table is configured.
- MQTT is configured.
- Run `curl` command from the client for the same endpoint.

The "connectivityFailures" value in the "Gatekeeper Health Stats" is incremented by one each time FSM fails to get the
verdict from Gatekeeper service due to connection errors.

## Implementation status

Not Implemented
