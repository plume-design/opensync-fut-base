# Testcase onbrd_verify_id_awlan_node

## Environment setup and dependencies

Ensure DUT is in OpenSync default state, as is after boot.

## Testcase description

The goal of this testcase is to validate `id` field format in the `AWLAN_Node` table. The testcase verifies the
following:

- The node ID must be unique in the world. The node ID is case-sensitive.
- The allowed character set is alphanumerical, with the addition of colon and underscore. No special characters are
  allowed.
- The node ID length must not exceed 81 (17 + 64) characters in any case.
- The node ID has to match either of these:
    - Device label
    - BLE beacon
    - QR code
- Optional: the node ID can also match the device MAC address, or the serial number.
- Optional: the node ID length must not exceed 12 characters if the device requires onboarding via BLE. The test will
  report a warning in all cases where the 12 character length limit is exceeded.

**Note:**\
FUT does not validate all criteria due to practical reasons. The testcase validates the node ID length and
character set.

## Expected outcome and pass criteria

The field `id` in the `AWLAN_Node` table is non-empty, and its length does not exceed 81 characters and contains only
allowed characters.

## Implementation status

Implemented
