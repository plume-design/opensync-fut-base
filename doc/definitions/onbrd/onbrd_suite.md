# ONBRD testing

## Overview

This test suite provides device verification for the onboarding process.

The test suite does not use any connection to the controller. The controller is simulated on the FUT RPI server which is
sufficient to keep the CM (_Connection Manager_) operational.

Other managers run normally.
